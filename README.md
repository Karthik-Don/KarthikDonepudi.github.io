Projects:
1. IGVC Robot
Intelligent Ground Vehicular Competition
Designed numerous components for the robot including some components like the camera guard for rain water protection, assembled and disassembled the robot.
CAD designing, and later assembling a robot that is going to participate in the IGVC(Intelligent Ground Vehicular Competition), an annual competition in which robots have to complete objectives, such as
o	Lane Following, obstacle, pedestrian, and pothole avoidance, road sign detection

2. Bridge design project
Project for a class called ID3EA I.
Each group member made 3 bridge designs on an application called Ftool. We modeled different loading conditions such as load and load placements and we measured displacement of the members. Then, we built the same bridge designs in real life and tested the load and load placements and measured displacement of the members. Then, we plotted each bridge design(Ftool simulation and real life experiment) for time vs member displacement.
The data analysis was plotting these on MATLAB and computing the percent difference between the Ftool simulation displacement and real-life displacement. Additionally and more importantly, we needed to find the bridge design that had the lowest displacement over a number of loading conditions.
The conclusion of the project was finding the best bridge design.
